## Creating route links and passing in values

I'm not using ASP.NET MVC as much and currently this web site is the only MVC project I'm working on. I was always using `new { ... }` for passing route values when creating links or URLs.

```Razor
@Html.ActionLink("View project detail", "Project", "Detail", new { ID = @project.ID })
```
