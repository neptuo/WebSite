    <Description>Chromium updater is Click-once application for downloading and updating latest builds of Chromium. The application offers automatic or manual download of latest build to selected folder and then extracting it there.</Description>
    <Text>
      <p>
        On first run, configuration tab is opened. The application requires folder for downloading zips to and this folder is prefilled with the application instalation folder. This can be quite problem, if the application installed to folder, where current user doesn't have write rights. So be sure to fill folder with write rights.
      </p>
      <p>
        Beside this, there are prefilled download URL and file name. These must match structure of Chromium builds structure on the server. This is recommended to not change...
      </p>
      <p>
        In the bottom there are some checkboxes for setting automatic downloads and etc. These should match most user preferences.
